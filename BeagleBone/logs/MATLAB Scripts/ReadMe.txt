The script that needs to be run is "main_script.m", the other file (wkv_split...) is just a function
that will be called in the main script, so you should put it somewhere in your MATLAB path.

Before running the script, you should load the .wkv log file into your MATLAB workspace by calling
wkv_load(). Also refer to the comments on top of the main_script.m before running it.
