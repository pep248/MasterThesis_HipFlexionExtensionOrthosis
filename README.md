# Simulation and implementation of a muscular based controllers to assist gait using a hip flexion-extension hip orthosis
This repo compiles a set of usefull files used during the realisation of the Master Thesis project "Simulation and implementation of a muscular based controllers to assist gait using a hip flexion-extension hip orthosis", as long as the [Final Master Thesis Report](https://github.com/pep248/MasterThesis_HipFlexionExtensionOrthosis/blob/main/JosepRuedaCollell_MasterThesis.pdf).

## Prerequistes
This repo assumes the user is on a Windows system.
Specific folders include files which may require MATLAB, OpenSim Software, SCONE Software and QtCreator. Each folder includes instructions on how to install these mentioned programs.

## Folders
* The BeagleBone
* Inside the [BeagleBone](https://github.com/pep248/MasterThesis_HipFlexionExtensionOrthosis/tree/main/BeagleBone) folder, we can find all the software regarding the control of the real orthosis, along with some log files and some MATLAB Scripts to Evaluate them..
* Inside the [Media](https://github.com/pep248/MasterThesis_HipFlexionExtensionOrthosis/tree/main/Media) folder, we can find videos recorded during the experiments and during the testing period of the project, when the controller was still in development.
* Inside the [SCONE Software](https://github.com/pep248/MasterThesis_HipFlexionExtensionOrthosis/tree/main/SCONE%20Software) folder, we can find all the files regarding the simulations, including actual simulation results, along with some MATLAB Scripts to evaluate them.
