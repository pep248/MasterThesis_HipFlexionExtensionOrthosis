# MATLAB Scripts
This folder includes the MATLAB Scripts used to extract data from the OpenSim plotting tool. It includes 3 random Excel files usefull to test the mentioned Scripts.

* The file [Book_torque_fit.m](https://github.com/pep248/MasterThesis_HipFlexionExtensionOrthosis/blob/main/SCONE%20Software/MATLAB%20Scripts/Book_torque_fit.m) is used to fit a sine wave to the torque profile obtained from M. H. Schwartz's Journal of Biomechanics Workbook.
* The file [activation_comparisson.m](ttps://github.com/pep248/MasterThesis_HipFlexionExtensionOrthosis/blob/main/SCONE%20Software/MATLAB%20Scripts/activation_comparisson.m) is used to obtain the activation signals of the three main muscles involved in the hip motion kinematics.
* The file [encoder_heelstrike.m](https://github.com/pep248/MasterThesis_HipFlexionExtensionOrthosis/blob/main/SCONE%20Software/MATLAB%20Scripts/encoder_heelstrike.m) is used to see the results of trying to split the gait using hip angles and velocities.
* The file [encoder_heelstrike.m](https://github.com/pep248/MasterThesis_HipFlexionExtensionOrthosis/blob/main/SCONE%20Software/MATLAB%20Scripts/poly_fourier_fit.m) is used to see the difference between using polynomial fitting and fourier fitting.
* The file [sine_chain_test.m](https://github.com/pep248/MasterThesis_HipFlexionExtensionOrthosis/blob/main/SCONE%20Software/MATLAB%20Scripts/sine_chain_test.m) displays the result of a case where we try to chain 4 waves of different period.
